__This respository contains the following tools for use when planning moving target observations:__

- `asteroid_thermal_model.ipynb`: Notebook that takes user input on basic minor body properties (visible geometric albedo, diameter, heliocentric distance, observer-centric distance) and outputs a model with reflected and thermal components over the desired wavelength range. This code uses the standard thermal model (STM) and does not include the beaming parameter as a free parameter or phase angle information for, specifically, determining the illuminated fraction of near-Earth asteroids (NEAs). See, e.g., Lebofsky et al. (1989) for more details on the STM.
  
- `moving_target_identifier.ipynb`: This tool is primarily intended for identifying moving targets (including minor bodies, planets, and planetary satellites) that would be viable targets for observatory testbed (OTB) testing and verification that is carried out throughtout the year. The tool uses the `astroquery.jplhorizons` module to retrieve the solar elongation and apparent angular rate quantities from JPL Horizons for planets outside of Earth's orbit (Mars to Neptune); the Galilean satellites, Titan, classical Uranian satellites, and Triton; near-Earth asteroids (NEAs); and a user-specified amount of low-numbered main belt asteroids (default is 100; low-numbered objects were discovered less recently and have higher-precision ephemerides). The user can specify the date range over which to search for viable targets; smaller windows likely require a larger number of objects to search through, depending on the desired apparent angular rate.
